# HYBRID_RR_CPU_SCHEDULLING
 The essential and important aspect of operating system is multiprogramming.
 Multiprogramming is a process or method of executing multiple processes simultaneously in the memory. Its main aim to minimize the average waiting time, average turnaround time and maximize the CPU utilization.
 The most widely used scheduling algorithm is Round robin scheduling among all of them. It is an optimal CPU scheduling algorithm in timeshared systems.
 In round robin algorithm the time quantum is static, and the performance of these algorithms is totally depending upon the selection of time quantum.
 This static time quantum decreases the performance of CPU scheduling like Average waiting time, average turnaround time and CPU utilization.
 This algorithm inherits the nature of both SJF and round robin algorithm therefore it is a Hybrid Algorithm. The objective of this project is to propose a new CPU scheduling algorithm which will perform better than the simple Round Robin in terms of minimizing average waiting time, average turnaround time and number of context switches.
